# kanionland-character-editor
A Python-Flask solution for Roleplay automation for Kanionland Characters stats, jobs, equipment, etc.

The tech stack chosen for this project will be using Python-Flask-SQLite-MongoDB. Mixing both types of databases will allow handling structured records for reiterative and relational records and values, while saving information regarding characters from former sheets in mutable formats.

## Executing locally
```
python app.py
```
The flask server will be running in https://localhost:5000
